# Sarvum Architecture

## Overview
Sarvum is a modular, service-oriented application designed to support multiple business domains under a unified platform. Each service operates independently and communicates via well-defined APIs, enabling scalability, maintainability, and rapid development.

## High-Level Architecture

```

```


## Communication
- **API Gateway**: Centralized routing and authentication
- **RESTful APIs**: Primary communication between services
- **Message Queue (optional)**: For async tasks and event-driven workflows

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python (varies by service)
- **Frontend**: React.js / Next.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions

## Security
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- HTTPS enforced across all services

## Scalability
- Services are containerized and deployed via Kubernetes
- Horizontal scaling supported for high-traffic modules

## Monitoring & Logging
- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
- ELK Stack for centralized logging
